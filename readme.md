## **Project Assumptions**

1. **WordPress Platform:** We assume that the website redesign will be built on WordPress. This involves familiarity with the platform and its themes and plugins.

2. **Migration Feasibility:** We assume that migration from Weebly to WordPress is possible and can be completed within the project timeline.

---

## **Project Constraints**

1. **Platform Migration Knowledge:** The team currently has limited knowledge on how to migrate from Weebly to WordPress. This could pose a challenge in the initial stages of the project.

2. **Domain Migration:** There is uncertainty about how to migrate the existing domain, which could potentially cause delays.
