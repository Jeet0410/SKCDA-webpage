# SKCDA (Saskatchewan Career Development Association) Webpage Redesign

### Project Description

---

The Saskatchewan Career Development Association is a professional group committed to aiding Career Development Practitioners (CDPs) throughout Saskatchewan. The SKCDA's purpose is to champion the career development sector, establish connections among its practitioners, and offer professional growth opportunities for CDPs.

The SKCDA seeks a website revamp to enhance its visual appeal and ease of navigation, with a focus on boosting membership. Key features should include a members-only networking area and resource sharing, emphasis on membership benefits, streamlined membership and payment forms, a query/mailing list sign-up section, and an updated section on national CDP certification.
